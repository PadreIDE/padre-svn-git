Based on
* http://blogs.perl.org/users/graham_knop/2010/12/converting-complex-svn-repositories-to-git-part-4.html
* https://github.com/haarg/convert-git-dbic/
* http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/GitMigration

HowTo
=====

cd ~/devel
git clone git://github.com/mj41/padre-svn-git.git padre-svn-git
cd padre-svn-git

See source code of each script before you try to run it.

1) Use prepared archives

Run these only once.

./00-init.sh sure
./01-sync.sh archive
./05-import.sh archive
./09-fix-svn-config.sh

These will download and unpack two archives (230 MB) from
https://github.com/mj41/padre-svn-git/downloads

2) Update and fix Git repository

Get new SVN changes and update Git repo.

./10-update.sh

Run all scripts already prepared/tested for fixing Git repo

./gitfix-all.sh run
