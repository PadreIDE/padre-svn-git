Must have
* fix trunk vs. trunk/Padre duplications, r1746
* remove empty commits
* fix authors
* fix "git-svn-id: file:///home/mj/..." in commit messages
* find and fix merges
* filter to separate repositories for Plugins
* create Padre organization on GitHub

Nice to have
* rebase branches history
* more tags for Plugin releases
